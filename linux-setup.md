This is a Step-by-step tutorial on how to start running PyCord in your Windows Computer!

### 1: Creating a Discord Bot

> These two intents are Required to run PyCord.

### 2: Setting up .env Bot Token Value
Now that we created a bot, we will now need it's token to start the bot.\
If you have 2 Factor Authorization in your Discord Account, you may need your [Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US) to proceed to this next step.

To get your Discord Bot Token, simply press **Reset Token** and click on **Copy**.
> If you have 2FA in your account, you will need to enter your Authentication Code before you can get your Discord Bot's token.

Now that we have our Discord Bot's token. we will now edit our .env file that's Included on the PyCord ZIP file.
