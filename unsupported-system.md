# PyCord on Unsupported System
If you want to use PyCord on an unsupported system, you can do that by installing Python inside your system and installing the required packages that PyCord needs to run by using the `pip install` command:

```
pip install httpx discord textual python_dotenv textual_inputs
```

Once done, you can download PyCord's Code inside the [Releases Page](https://github.com/PyTsun/PyCord/releases) or copy the code inside [the Repo](https://github.com/PyTsun/PyCord/blob/main/PyCord.py) then run it inside **Windows Terminal** (you don't need Windows Terminal to run PyCord if your on linux) with the command `python PyCord.py`. Just make sure that you are inside the correct directory to run that command.
