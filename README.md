# PyCord
**PyCord** is a Discord Terminal Client which uses your Discord Bot as a normal User Account!

## Damn
PyCord is currently getting a full rewrite since the Textual library I'm using was currently updated to look better.\
A new PyCord update may take a while since it got even harder.

## PyCord Features
- Emoji Support (no Custom Emoji)
- Multi-Language Support
- Low CPU Usage
- Low RAM Usage (depends on how many servers it's in)
- Reply to Users
- Leave Servers
- Handles an average twitter user's messages (can display long messages without breaking the interface)
