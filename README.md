# PyCord
**PyCord** is a Discord Terminal Client which uses your Discord Bot like a normal User Account!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
PyCord is a third-party client and violates Discord's Terms of Service. as stated in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/discord/status/1229357198918197248?lang=en)

PyCord was made specially for my own use and for discord to stop using alot of my RAM while using it.\
I'm not sure if this type of Discord Client is allowed, since it works by using a Discord Bot as your "User Account". *but still a third-party tho.*\
Just to be safe, I don't recommend using PyCord as your main Discord Client since you might get banned from discord from using this.

## üóíÔ∏è Note to Windows Users
Please Install **Windows Terminal** to use PyCord! The Textual Library that PyCord uses does not support classic Windows Terminals.
